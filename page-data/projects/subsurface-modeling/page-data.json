Traditional numerical methods often struggle with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Computational efficiency when dealing with large-scale, high-resolution models</li>\n<li>Incorporating uncertainty quantification in predictions</li>\n<li>Handling complex multi-phase flow phenomena</li>\n<li>Visualizing and interpreting 3D/4D subsurface data effectively</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we're doing</h2>\n<p>Our approach integrates several cutting-edge techniques:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</strong>: We embed physical constraints directly into neural network architectures to ensure physically consistent predictions while leveraging the flexibility of deep learning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multi-scale Modeling</strong>: We develop hierarchical methods that capture flow phenomena across different spatial and temporal scales, from pore-scale to reservoir-scale.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Advanced Visualization</strong>: We create interactive visualization tools that enable geoscientists to explore complex subsurface data intuitively, including flow patterns, pressure distributions, and saturation fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uncertainty Quantification</strong>: We employ Bayesian methods and ensemble techniques to quantify uncertainty in subsurface properties and propagate it through flow predictions.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Progress</h2>\n<p>Our recent achievements include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Development of a GPU-accelerated subsurface flow simulator that achieves 100x speedup compared to traditional CPU-based methods</li>\n<li>Implementation of a novel neural network architecture that preserves mass conservation in heterogeneous media</li>\n<li>Creation of an immersive VR visualization system for exploring 3D subsurface flow patterns</li>\n<li>Successful application to real-world groundwater contamination scenarios with improved prediction accuracy</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Collaborators</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering, UT Austin</li>\n<li>Environmental Science Institute</li>\n<li>Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Publications</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>R.
